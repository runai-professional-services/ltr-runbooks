Welcome to "Learn to Run". Here are some of the artifacts you will need for the practical elements of the course

### Logging into your instance

You will need to connect to your instance using SSH. In order to authenticate you will need [this](./my-key.pem) private key.

It should be treated as a secret. It will be rotated at the end of the course. You should download it into a directory accessible from your terminal and connect using the connection string on the [student's page](./students.md)
