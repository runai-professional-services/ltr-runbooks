*Hint - Use the official run:ai documentation*

## Create Departments

- Create two departments, each with a quota of 8 GPUs. 

## Create Projects

- Under Department A create three projects
- Divide the quota as you wish
- Under Department B create two projects


## Create Nodepools

- Create nodepool named h100 from one node
- Create nodepool named h200 from two nodes

## Edit the projects

The quotas are set only to default nodepool, we need to redistrbiute them.
- Allocate Quota for Department A's projects to nodepool h100
- Allocate Quota for Department B's projects to nodepool h200
